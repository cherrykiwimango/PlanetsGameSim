# PlanetsGameSim
Flutter project, mobile app with a cute solar system simulation.

I have added some custom planets and illustrations and a speed up effect on tap down. 
The illustrations are inspired by art from Kurzgesagt (science education youtube channel)
Planning on extending it into a game in the future :))
